        <h3>
          The Stormlight Archive (4 book series) Kindle Edition by Brandon
          Sanderson (Author) From Book 1: From #1 New York Times bestselling
          author Brandon Sanderson, The Way of Kings, Book One of the Stormlight
          Archive begins an incredible new saga of epic proportion.
        </h3>
        <p>
          Roshar is a world of stone and storms. Uncanny tempests of incredible
          power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have
          shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees
          pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities
          are built only where the topography offers shelter.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders
          known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate
          remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men
          into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades.
          Wars were fought for them, and won by them.
        </p>
        <p>
          One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains.
          There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to
          protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that
          makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single
          foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who
          consider them expendable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his
          brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called The
          Way of Kings. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and
          the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train
          under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar's niece,
          Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan's motives are
          less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah
          hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.
        </p>
        <p>
          The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building,
          The Way of Kings is but the opening movement of the Stormlight
          Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.
